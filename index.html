      <section id="main_content">
        <p>== Welcome to The Simplest CMS EVER!!
There are three basic sections to this site
1) root =&gt; /: This is the page the application defaults to. It shows a menu with created pages and the first page of the list(database). If no page has been created yet, the first user will be redirected to the admin side to create a page
2) blog =&gt; /blog. This is the blog side of the site. Admin is allowed to created a blog and leave a comment
3) admin =&gt; /admin: This is the admin section if the site. admin is allowed to create a page, add components to a page, edit components, delete components,or re-order the components on the page.</p>

<p>Component: Using single table inheritance, I have implemented three basic types of components. 
    i)The basic component, this is basically a title and content
    ii)The poll. Accepts a title and a poll question. 
    iii)The blog roll. this just accepts a title.
The basic component can be moved around the page(drag and drop) or resized.
Menu on the user side, grows dynamically as pages are added.
A Blog is included.
Components may be dragged across the page and resized.</p>

<p>There is no save. Once you are finished editing your page, go back to the page list. everything shall be saved. Not very intuitive, I know.</p>

<p>BUGS:</p>

<ul>
<li>A JQuery UI mis-function causes the component to fly to the bottom of the page when resized. But if you find it and pull it back it will work just fine.</li>
<li>I was trying STI for the first time, and while it is an amazing implementation of inheritance. It calls the generic component template the first time a component is rendered rather than the specific poll or recent blog template.</li>
<li>Code is not as DRY as I would like it to be.</li>
</ul>
