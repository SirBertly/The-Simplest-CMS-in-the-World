== Welcome to The Simplest CMS EVER!!
There are three basic sections to this site
1) root => /: This is the page the application defaults to. It shows a menu with created pages and the first page of the list. If a page has not been create, the first user will be redirected to the admin side to create a page
2) blog => /blog. This is the blog side of the site. Admin is allowed to created a blog, leave a comment etc etc, typical blog operations.
3) admin => /admin: This is the admin section if the site. admin is allowed to create a page, add components to a page, edit components, delete components,or re-order the components on the page.

Component: Using single table inheritance, I have implemented three basic types of components. 
    i)The basic component, this is basically a title and content
    ii)The poll. Accepts a title and a poll question. 
    iii)The blog roll. this just accepts a title.
The basic component can be oved around the page(drag and drop) or resized.


BUGS:
- A JQuery UI mis-function causes the component to fly to the bottom of the page when resized. But if you find it and pull it back it will work just fine.
- I have a before_filter that I need to fix. It adds 1 to vote when vote is edited.
